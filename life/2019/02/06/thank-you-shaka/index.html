        <p>There is a man named Shaka<br />
who shot and killed someone<br />
when he was only 19.</p>

<p>Tried, convicted, and unrepentant,<br />
he spent 19 years in prison,<br />
and 7 years in solitary confinement,<br />
alone with his tortured thoughts.</p>

<p>Through Grace,<br />
and the truth he found <br />
in the writings of others,<br />
he was able to discover<br />
that he was the cause<br />
of his own suffering,<br />
and that he had a choice<br />
about who he wanted to become.</p>

<p>I have had an easy life,<br />
free of the horrors he endured,<br />
but I, too, have spent too many years<br />
trapped in the prison of my thoughts,<br />
victim of my own self-induced suffering.</p>

<p>Surely, <br />
having lived a life of privilege,<br />
I can find the strength <br />
to free myself as he did,<br />
and become the person<br />
I was meant to be.</p>

<p>Thank you, Shaka,<br />
for the light you spread!</p>

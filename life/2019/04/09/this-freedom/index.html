​<br />
Once again,<br />
you have “pushed my button”<br />
(or so my thoughts<br />
would tell me).<br />
​<br />
And so,<br />
I would feel compelled<br />
to push back at you,<br />
if my thoughts were true,<br />
if that button were real.<br />
​<br />
But, as I stand aside<br />
and watch this parade<br />
of thoughts and feelings,<br />
as if on the shore<br />
of a roiling stream,<br />
I may choose to only watch,<br />
and not jump in.<br />
​<br />
Thank you, <br />
my would-be adversary, <br />
for this reminder,<br />
that I have always had <br />
this freedom,<br />
to engage or not engage,<br />
no matter what you do.</p>

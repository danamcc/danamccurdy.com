driving him always<br />
to share his bad ideas,<br />
his anger and his fear,<br />
so they will spread like a virus,<br />
until he does not feel so alone.</p>

<p>We could pity him,<br />
or offer our compassion,<br />
if his will were not so corrosive,<br />
inflaming the worst <br />
that lies dormant in all of us.</p>

<p>We could even forgive him,<br />
if, through some karmic twist,<br />
he were stripped of his power, <br />
moved from the center of things,<br />
and left, like most of us,<br />
in his own private world.</p>

<p>But now,<br />
we are all culpable<br />
for the spread of his disease,<br />
until we share responsibility<br />
for this fevered dream<br />
we share with him,<br />
until we will ourselves<br />
to awaken.</p>

    <!-- The introduction for both poem listings (both life and love poems). -->

<p>Beyond the world of discovery that music has been for me, there was always the bigger world, the universe of questions about what we’re a part of, how it works, and how to best fit into the larger whole.</p>

<p>My love of words, a fascination with scientific, philosophical, and spiritual inquiry, and a quiet determination to learn how to be a better human (and a happier man) have led me on a path of shaping my experience, breath by breath, into poems.</p>

<p>Here are some of them.</p>

        <p>In love, we are united;<br />
in anger and fear, we are divided.</p>

<p>Anger<br />
is the inability or unwillingness<br />
to accept what is.</p>

<p>Fear<br />
is the inability or unwillingness<br />
to accept what might be.</p>

<p>They are the seeds of chaos,<br />
sown by those who would prefer to see us helpless,<br />
unable to meet the ups and downs of life effectively.</p>

<p>Anger and fear are the toxins that sap our power,<br />
leaving us paralyzed by negativity,<br />
unable to relieve our own suffering,<br />
or the suffering of others.</p>

        <p><em>Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing. - Helen Keller</em></p>

<p>Our purpose in life<br />
is not to hold on,<br />
but to let go,<br />
enjoying each moment<br />
as best we can,<br />
sharing our joy<br />
as much as we can.</p>

<p>And the way to let go<br />
is to just stop holding on,<br />
to give up grasping so tightly<br />
at the myth of safety and security.</p>

<p>There is no effort in letting go,<br />
just a giving up of effort,<br />
an abandonment of fear,<br />
a surrender to what is.</p>

<p>The purpose of your life<br />
was not to hold on,<br />
but to let go<br />
and surrender to what is,<br />
always determined<br />
to enjoy each moment,<br />
and to share your joy <br />
with us all.</p>

        <p>There are those in our government<br />
who have no concern <br />
for our wellbeing,<br />

<p>They are drunk on power,<br />
guarding their interests<br />
with every ounce of control<br />
they can manage,<br />
twisting the narrative<br />
of what concerns us all<br />
to their own advantage,<br />

<p>Their weapons are words,<br />
levers to pry away our reason,<br />
flames to ignite our fears.</p>

<p>But words are only dangerous<br />
when they are believed,<br />
supplanting our natural knowing<br />
of what is right and wrong.</p>

<p>We are not helpless,<br />
when we listen carefully,<br />
follow our hearts,<br />
and step up when we are called,<br />
to use our citizenship<br />
as it was meant to be used,<br />
and express our will<br />
as a people.</p>

no end of suffering,<br />

the doubts and fears<br />
born of an overactive mind.</p>

I have caused myself,<br />

<p>Regret and forgiveness<br />

<p>Without regret,<br />
I would forget <br />

need never have been,<br />
if I had seen <br />
that it was all my own creation.</p>

<p>And without forgiveness,<br />
I would forget <br />
that I have always been worthy<br />
of the peace that comes<br />
when doubts and fears dwindle,<br />
and the suffering ceases.</p>

        <p>Sometimes I hear arguments<br />
inside my head,<br />

<p>They are only passing thoughts,<br />
of course,<br />

they grow louder,<br />
more solid and real,<br />
the more I  believe in them.</p>

<p>When I stop to watch and listen,<br />
I am like the viewer <br />

wondering how and why<br />
I gave my time and energy<br />
to such flimsy fictions.</p>

<p>And when I see myself<br />
watching from a peaceful place,<br />
I lose interest in their noisy clamor,<br />
and they seem to fade away,<br />
back to the emptiness<br />
from which they came.</p>

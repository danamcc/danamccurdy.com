    <!-- The introduction for both poem listings (both life and love poems). -->

<p>Beyond the world of discovery that music has been for me, there was always the bigger world, the universe of questions about what we’re a part of, how it works, and how to best fit into the larger whole.</p>

<p>My love of words, a fascination with scientific, philosophical, and spiritual inquiry, and a quiet determination to learn how to be a better human (and a happier man) have led me on a path of shaping my experience, breath by breath, into poems.</p>

<p>Here are some of them.</p>

        <p>sometimes we need to bleed a little<br />
before we can begin to heal</p>

<p>sometimes a scab is a protection <br />
that is no longer needed, <br />
and ripping it off <br />
is the only way forward</p>

<p>being with the pain we hid from <br />
is the path to reclaiming our power, <br />

and the patience to keep walking,<br />
step by step, towards the light</p>

        <p>I was dreaming, and in my dream,<br />
I had this thought: I am walking by <br />
an old fashioned phone booth,<br />
and as I pass, the phone rings.</p>

<p>I answer it and say hello,<br />
and a voice on the phone says “yes”.</p>

<p>I ask it meaningless questions,<br />
and each time, the voice says “yes”.</p>

<p>And then I asked:<br />
“Is it important what questions I ask?”,<br />
and the voice said “yes”.</p>

<p>And I asked: <br />
“Is this me I’m talking to?”,<br />
and again the voice said “yes”.</p>

<p>And so I asked: <br />
“What should I say to life?”,<br />
and the voice said “yes”.</p>

<p>And <br />
“What should I say to each day?”,<br />
and once more the voice said “yes”.</p>

<p>“What should I say to each moment?”;<br />
again the voice said “yes”.</p>

<p>“What word should I carry always <br />
in my heart and mind?”,<br />
and, as I walked on,<br />
the voice in my head said softly:</p>

<p>“yes”.</p>

        <p>This unsettled feeling<br />
has been with me all my life,<br />
and will probably be with me<br />
as long as I think and breathe.</p>

<p>I have tried my best to quell it,<br />
soothe it, run away from it,<br />
and it does fade away, <br />
in time, until it returns,<br />
in its own cycle <br />
of coming and going.</p>

<p>I am not in control of it,<br />
and never will be.</p>

<p>It has a life of its own,<br />
which I have been ignoring.</p>

<p>I have made it my enemy,<br />
and spent countless hours<br />
and endless energy<br />
trying to banish it.</p>

<p>But it is a part of me,<br />
and it is only my mind,<br />
trying to control itself,<br />
that would have it be otherwise.</p>

<p>There is no enemy,<br />
there is only a myth <br />
of what should not be.</p>

<p>How much simpler<br />
to embrace the truth,<br />
and be unsettled<br />
when I’m unsettled,<br />
at peace when I’m at peace,<br />
not always struggling<br />
to be different<br />
from how I am.</p>

rooms as big as the universe, <br />

porous, empty, <br />

    <!-- The introduction for both poem listings (both life and love poems). -->

<p>Beyond the world of discovery that music has been for me, there was always the bigger world, the universe of questions about what we’re a part of, how it works, and how to best fit into the larger whole.</p>

<p>My love of words, a fascination with scientific, philosophical, and spiritual inquiry, and a quiet determination to learn how to be a better human (and a happier man) have led me on a path of shaping my experience, breath by breath, into poems.</p>

<p>Here are some of them.</p>

        <p>When we come together <br />
to drum and dance,<br />
it is our agreement,<br />
unspoken among us,<br />
to abandon our apparent differences,<br />
and to celebrate <br />
all that connects us.</p>

<p>In this sacred circle,<br />
we agree to talk <br />
only through our drumming,<br />
and not with our words;<br />
not as individuals,<br />
but only as one being.</p>

<p>We agree to focus <br />
on communicating <br />
through our rhythms,<br />
with which we share <br />
this sacred space,<br />
and not through a cell phone<br />
(that digital garden of ego),<br />
with those whose approval<br />
we so habitually seek.</p>

<p>We agree to set aside <br />
this sense of “me”,<br />
if only for the moment,<br />
and, immersed in this rhythmic communion,<br />
to allow ourselves to melt back <br />
to our common source,<br />
where all there is<br />
is “us”.</p>

        <p><em>(A reflection on mindfulness and social media)</em></p>

<p>The most powerful question I have ever heard<br />
is “Where are you directing your energy?”</p>

<p>Every word, or thought, or image<br />
that we add to our informational soup<br />
becomes part of this sea of ideas<br />
that we all swim and breathe in.</p>

<p>And just as our oceans <br />
become befouled<br />
with our waste,<br />
so does our virtual sea<br />
grow murky and toxic<br />
with a million tokens <br />
of emotional violence<br />
tossed carelessly into its depths.</p>

<p>And just as the Earth, our Mother,<br />
has graced us <br />
with this beautiful and nurturing home,<br />
so have we been gifted,<br />
through own brilliance,<br />
with this digital ocean,<br />
in which we are privileged <br />
to share a universe <br />
of feelings and ideas.</p>

<p>So, as we drift <br />
in our little boats of identity,<br />
there is a chance for each of us, <br />
as we toss our minds’ progeny<br />
into the depths around us,<br />
to pause, and wonder,<br />
“If this were the only thing <br />
that comprised this sea,<br />
would these be the kind of waters <br />
I would choose for myself <br />
and those I love<br />
to swim in?”</p>

        <p>You don’t have to like<br />
those who seem different from you,<br />
but you would be happier<br />
if you did.</p>

<p>Your anger is only a shield<br />
that covers your fear,<br />
the urge to be rid of<br />
all who seem to threaten<br />
your sense of identity.</p>

<p>But it is YOU<br />
who built this wall around you,<br />
brick by brick,<br />
borrowing ignorance and prejudice<br />
from those around you,<br />
until you see yourself only<br />
as this wall that separates you<br />
from the rest of humanity.</p>

<p>What if you refrained<br />
from pushing away<br />
all that you don’t understand?</p>

<p>And what if you refrained<br />
from allowing your inner fears<br />
to drive your outer behavior?</p>

<p>What if you began to relax your grip<br />
on how you have shaped yourself,<br />
and, bit by bit, shifted your focus<br />
from how they are different from you,<br />
to how you have made yourself<br />
different from them?</p>

        <p>Everything in this universe <br />
(and perhaps beyond)<br />
is interdependent.</p>

<p>There is no “thing”<br />
that has its own existence,<br />
apart from all others.</p>

<p>And there is nothing<br />
which is not impermanent,<br />
that can exist outside of <br />
a constant state of change.</p>

<p>All that we see are the forms<br />
that matter, energy, and thought<br />
give rise to, in the flow of time.</p>

<p>Each thing we perceive<br />
is the sum of smaller parts,<br />
each made of smaller parts still,<br />
going all the way down.</p>

<p>Each form we know<br />
was born from an earlier form,<br />
itself born from one earlier still,<br />
going all the way down.</p>

<p>If we look for a first cause,<br />
it is as if our Earth<br />
were carried on the back <br />
of a giant turtle,<br />
itself on the back<br />
of another giant turtle, <br />
and so on, and so on,<br />
all the way down.</p>

<p>Without these turtles,<br />
do we have a place to stand on,<br />
or do we need one,<br />
as we look out,<br />
as the eyes of the universe,<br />
from nowhere,<br />
into everything?</p>

        <p>Love can be <br />
like cool, clear water,<br />
when it isn’t muddied<br />
by need.</p>

<p>Relax your hold<br />
on what you want to keep,<br />
and revel in the flow,<br />
as objects of love<br />
come and go, <br />
and what remains<br />
is love itself.</p>

<p>All the love<br />
we find outside ourselves<br />
is only a mirror<br />
of the love we are made of.</p>

<p>When we look back,<br />
and see our own reflection,<br />
then there is an end<br />
to our search for completeness.</p>

    <!-- The introduction for both poem listings (both life and love poems). -->

<p>Beyond the world of discovery that music has been for me, there was always the bigger world, the universe of questions about what we’re a part of, how it works, and how to best fit into the larger whole.</p>

<p>My love of words, a fascination with scientific, philosophical, and spiritual inquiry, and a quiet determination to learn how to be a better human (and a happier man) have led me on a path of shaping my experience, breath by breath, into poems.</p>

<p>Here are some of them.</p>

        <p><em>Whenever we communicate, we always have a choice:<br />
to do it mindfully, or to suffer the consequences.</em></p>

<p>In this age <br />
of technological wonders,<br />
it is easier and easier<br />
to share our grievances,<br />
and just as easy<br />
to share our joy.</p>

<p>Each message we send<br />
is like an impulse<br />
coursing through a vast mind<br />
that spans the globe,<br />
surrounding us,<br />
engulfing us,<br />
its collective thoughts<br />
insinuating themselves<br />
into our own thoughts.</p>

<p>We are like the neurons<br />
of this world-wide mind,<br />
each of us firing<br />
with love or hate,<br />
compassion or anger,<br />
each time we share<br />
our hearts or minds.</p>

<p>We are the conscious components<br />
of an expanding super-consciousness, <br />
growing and morphing <br />
as we feed it.</p>

<p>And our peace of mind, <br />
our spiritual well being,<br />
perhaps our survival <br />
depend more and more<br />
on how we feed it.</p>

        <p>There is a man named Shaka<br />
who shot and killed someone<br />
when he was only 19.</p>

<p>Tried, convicted, and unrepentant,<br />
he spent 19 years in prison,<br />
and 7 years in solitary confinement,<br />
alone with his tortured thoughts.</p>

<p>Through Grace,<br />
and the truth he found <br />
in the writings of others,<br />
he was able to discover<br />
that he was the cause<br />
of his own suffering,<br />
and that he had a choice<br />
about who he wanted to become.</p>

<p>I have had an easy life,<br />
free of the horrors he endured,<br />
but I, too, have spent too many years<br />
trapped in the prison of my thoughts,<br />
victim of my own self-induced suffering.</p>

<p>Surely, <br />
having lived a life of privilege,<br />
I can find the strength <br />
to free myself as he did,<br />
and become the person<br />
I was meant to be.</p>

<p>Thank you, Shaka,<br />
for the light you spread!</p>

        <p>I have struggled,<br />
for much of my life,<br />
to keep my worst<br />
from those around me,<br />
but, all too often,<br />
I have withheld my best<br />
as well.</p>

<p>I have been afraid to love<br />
and be loved<br />
simply as myself.</p>

<p>In this painful prison,<br />
the joy of authenticity<br />
is hard to find,<br />
and the boundless belonging<br />
of an open heart<br />
is likewise scarce.</p>

<p>Why have I settled<br />
for so little,<br />
for so long,<br />
so willing to trade joy <br />
for safety?</p>

<p>It has been a fool’s bargain,<br />
a burden, slowly crumbling<br />
under its own weight.</p>

<p>Bit by bit,<br />
I feel it falling away,<br />
until all that will be left,<br />
if I am blessed by grace,<br />
is me and the world,<br />
with nothing in between.</p>

        <p>The universe does not care <br />
what we think about it, <br />
but the more that we care,<br />
the less we are connected with it,<br />

becomes the map <br />
we use to make our way within it.</p>

<p>And thus we live our separate lives,<br />
each in our own imagined landscape,<br />
born from our assumptions and prejudices,<br />
blind to the changes and surprises<br />
that life is mostly made of.</p>

<p>But there are times<br />
when we come to the edge of our map,<br />
bumping into borders <br />
we have imagined into being.</p>

<p>Then, by Grace,<br />
we may look over the edge,<br />
and see the world’s true form,<br />
in all its dazzling presence.</p>

<p>Beyond every wall we build,<br />
there is a vista <br />
surpassing understanding,<br />
confounding our expectations,<br />
out past the limits<br />
of hope and fear.</p>

title: Infinite Spaces

There are rooms and windows in my mind, 
cavernous spaces, little compartments, 
flowing winds, flowing water, 
still places, darkness, light, 
rooms as big as the universe, 
rooms as tiny as a single thought. 

I walk, or swim, or fly 
through these infinite spaces, 
sometimes in my body, 
sometimes transparent, 
porous, empty, 
like a soft breath of air. 

Sometimes there is nothing 
but endless emptiness, 
open in every direction, 
and I am the formless observer, 
as endless and open 
as what is all around me.

Don’t be afraid 
of your own energy.

You may label it
“good” or “bad”,
but it is just 
the life force
of the universe,
expressing itself
through you.

You may have hidden from it,
for all these years,
because it felt bigger than you
and might swallow you up,
but it IS you,
and you are safe 
in its embrace.

And you will know this
in your heart and soul, 
when you stop struggling
against it.

In the flow of energy 
that we call life,
everything is impermanent,
and the things we love
pass in and out of existence,
along with everything else.

There is joy to be had
in what is present,
and grief in what is lost,
but what remains, always,
is Love itself.

If you open up your heart to grief,
it will open up to love as well - 
love for what once was,
love for all that is,
and love for all
that ever will be.

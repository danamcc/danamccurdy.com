Everything is impermanent
in this flow of energy we call life,
and the things we love
pass in and out of existence,
like everything else.

There is joy in what is present,
and grief in what is lost,
but what remains
is love itself.

Open up your heart to grief,
and it will open up to love as well,
love for what once was,
love for all that is,
and love for all
that will ever be.

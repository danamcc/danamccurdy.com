This body of mine 
is like a trusted old car.

There are some parts 
that don’t work as well 
as they used to,
but it gets me 
where I need to go. 

Every day that it takes me 
a bit further down my path 
is a gift I will receive gratefully,
never taking for granted
each moment that I’m still here.

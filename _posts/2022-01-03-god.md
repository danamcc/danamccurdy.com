The god I believe in
is God The Creator.

She gives birth to everything,
in every moment,
as She always has,
and always will.

She does not judge or label,
as humans do -
she embodies all things,
without words or judgement.

She does not watch
any person or thing -
that is what humans do.

She does not feel joy or wonder -
that is what humans do;
we are the witnesses
of Her creation,
as we were created to be.

She does not love,
as humans do -
She IS love,
as is the GOD
in each of us.

_There is no way to know what life will bring,
but there IS a way to be ready for it._

Why do we try so hard
to avoid the inevitable?

Embrace it,
and a door will open
to all things possible.

There will be pain
and discomfort,
sadness and regret.

And also,
the boundless joy
of feeling fully alive.

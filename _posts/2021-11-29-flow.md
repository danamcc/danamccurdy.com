Floating, 
floating down, 
always down, 
weightless, 
like a feather on a stream, 
always flowing down. 

Sometimes slowly, softly, 
sometimes hard and swift, 
always flowing down. 

A part of the stream, 
a part of a wave, 
always flowing down. 

There may be a bottom, 
an end somewhere, 
but this flow, 
right here, right now,
is all there is;
this is life.

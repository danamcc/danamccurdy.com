…and the trouble with concepts is that they don’t always relate to reality in a useful way. Only direct experience can reveal what concepts are useful in a given moment. And to have a direct experience, you have to give up all your concepts, at least for a moment.

And the trouble with direct experience is that it’s not always comfortable, so we tend to wrap ourselves in a cocoon of our favorite concepts, lulled by the thoughts that are most familiar and agreeable to us. 

And as long as we stay there, avoiding discomfort, we are cut off from direct experience, from the vibrancy of what is.

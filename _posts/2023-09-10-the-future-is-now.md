title: The Future is Now

As I look out 
on the city before me,
in this year of 2023
(a year of the wildest dreams
of my distant youth),
I see the present - a future 
we could never have imagined.

The river of time does not flow 
along the stream of our imaginings;
it winds through a myriad of dimensions
our linear minds will never follow.

Perhaps it is not our job to navigate,
but instead, to witness in awe
the wonderment of the ride.

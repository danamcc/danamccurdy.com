I am grateful 
to be an American.

I am grateful 
for the diverse beauty of this land,
and for the richness 
of its diverse people and cultures.

And I regret the wrongs 
that those who govern us
have sometimes committed,
but I am grateful for our freedom
to right those wrongs,
when we have the will to do so,
and to speak out
whenever we see them.

I am grateful 
for what we are,
but I am more grateful
for what we can become.

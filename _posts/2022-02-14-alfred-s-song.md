Alfred’s song
was a strong song,
a song of passion, 
a song of life.

A song that says
that every life is sacred,
that every soul 
deserves kindness,
compassion, and respect.

And, as his voice is silenced,
it is our gift and tribute
to carry that song forward,
singing it in our hearts,
and raising our voices together,
in celebration, and remembering.

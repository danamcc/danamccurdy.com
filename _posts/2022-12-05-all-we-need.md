Why do we mythologize ourselves,
inventing little nuggets 
of meaning and drama,
shaping our lives into the form 
of a well-loved story?

Should it not be enough 
that each one of us 
is an inexplicable miracle, 
in a universe of miracles?

Why explain the ineffable,
when accepting it with wonder
is all we really need?

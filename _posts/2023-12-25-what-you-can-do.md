_While cleaning out the cat box and repairing a urine-stained part of its enclosure, this flash of insight dawned:_

The “best you can do”,
at any given moment,
is most likely just the best 
you were WILLING to do,
in that particular moment.

Look past your willingness,
in that particular moment,
past your comfort,
in that  moment,
and discover the power
of what you actually can do.

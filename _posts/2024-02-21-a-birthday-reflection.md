It’s been seventy two spins 
around the sun 
since I popped out 
of my mother’s womb,
and here I am, 
grateful to be here still,
for yet another year.

What a gift,
to know that life itself
is the greatest gift,
and that all I really need
is to savor and enjoy 
each moment,
to greet each day
with an open mind
and an open heart.

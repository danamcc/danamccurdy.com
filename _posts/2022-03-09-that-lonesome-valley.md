sometimes we need to bleed a little
before we can heal 

sometimes a scab is a protection 
we no longer need, and ripping it off 
becomes the way forward 

being with the pain we were hiding from 
is the path to reclaiming our power, 
the strength to walk that lonesome valley, 
and the patience to keep walking,
step by step, towards the light

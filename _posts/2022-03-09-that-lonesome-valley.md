sometimes we need to bleed a little
before we can begin to heal 

sometimes a scab is a shield 
that is no longer needed, 
and ripping it off 
is the only way forward 

being with the pain we hid from 
is the path to reclaiming our power, 
the strength to walk that lonesome valley, 
and the patience to keep walking,
step by step, towards the light

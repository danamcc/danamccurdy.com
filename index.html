<p>For me, life is about learning and creative expression. My goal as a human being and a professional is to promote and facilitate these in every way I can.</p>

<p>As an educator, consultant, musician, facilitator, and writer, I look for ways to empower myself and others to share who we are with creativity, clarity, and compassion.</p>

<p>I invite you to explore these paths with me in the links below, and share my take on some avenues for expressing our human experience more fully.</p>

      <p>Ever since I first heard the Beatles’ “I Am the Walrus” as a teenager, I’ve been fascinated by the art and science of music technology, and how it contributes to the process of creative music making.</p>

      <h1><a href="/music_production/">Music & Production</a></h1>
      <p>From childhood on, I’ve always been surrounded by music and musicians, and felt inspired to follow in their footsteps, both through creating my own music, and supporting others in doing likewise.</p>

      <h1><a href="/drum_circles/">Drum Circles</a></h1>
      <p>Rhythm has always been the most compelling and visceral aspect of music for me. The sheer variety and power of percussive sounds has led me to explore the endless potential of various hand drums and percussion instruments, on my own and with others.</p>

      <h1><a href="/poems/index.html">Poems</a></h1>
      <p>Beyond the world of discovery that music has been for me, there was always the bigger world, a universe of questions about what we’re all part of, how it works, and how we can best fit into the larger whole.</p>

      <p>As I strive for inner peace and clarity, I can’t help but notice how many challenges there are to pursuing that goal out there in the world at large.</p>
